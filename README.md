# Bengaluru Reservoir Water Level Prediction

This project was developed for the Skillenza Hackathon, where the challenge was to predict the water levels of reservoirs in Bengaluru city. Leveraging historical water level data and employing advanced time series analysis techniques, specifically the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, we aimed to provide accurate predictions for Bengaluru's reservoir water levels.

## Project Files:

- **ARIMA Model.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook file contains the implementation of the ARIMA model for time series forecasting. We used this notebook to perform in-depth analysis, data preprocessing, and model training on the Bengaluru reservoir water level dataset.

- **Hydrological model.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook file focuses on the implementation of a hydrological model. It includes data processing, feature engineering, and the development of a customized model tailored to predict water levels in Bengaluru's reservoirs.

## Datasets:

- **bengaluru(1).csv:** This dataset contains historical water level data specific to Bengaluru's reservoirs. We utilized this dataset for training and evaluating our predictive models.

- **chennai_reservoir_levels.csv:** Additional dataset containing reservoir water level data from Chennai. While not directly used in our analysis, it might be valuable for comparative purposes or future enhancements.

## How to Use the Notebooks:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Open Jupyter Notebooks:**
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `ARIMA Model.ipynb` and `Hydrological model.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

3. **Run the Notebooks:**
   - Run the cells sequentially to see the step-by-step data analysis, model implementation, and evaluation processes.

4. **Explore and Experiment:**
   - Feel free to experiment with different parameters, data preprocessing techniques, or models to improve the accuracy of water level predictions.

## Project Overview:

Our goal was to create an accurate and reliable model for predicting Bengaluru's reservoir water levels. We leveraged ARIMA modeling techniques and developed a customized hydrological model to achieve this objective. This project serves as a foundation for understanding and predicting water levels, contributing to vital water resource management in the city.
